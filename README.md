# Zomato-Data-Analysis
Overview
This project aims to analyze Zomato sales data to identify trends in restaurant categories, customer preferences, online ordering, and ratings. The insights derived from this analysis can be useful for restaurant owners, food delivery platforms, and businesses in the F&B industry to make data-driven decisions and improve customer satisfaction.

* Objectives
  The main objectives of this analysis are:

To categorize restaurants based on their service type (Dining, Delivery, etc.).
To determine customer preferences and identify which type of restaurant is most popular.
To analyze the availability of online ordering and its impact on sales.
To examine restaurant ratings and identify factors that might influence customer reviews.
To provide actionable insights that can help businesses improve their offerings.

Restaurant Name – Name of the restaurant.
Restaurant Type – Category such as Dining, Delivery, etc.
Online Order Acceptance – Whether the restaurant accepts online orders or not.
Ratings – Customer ratings for the restaurant.
Other relevant attributes – Additional features that provide context to the data.

* Key Insights from Analysis
  The analysis revealed several important trends:

1. Majority of restaurants fall under the Dining category
   The data suggests that most restaurants prefer to operate as dine-in establishments rather than delivery-only services.

2. Dining restaurants are more popular among customers

  Python – For data analysis and manipulation.
  Pandas – For handling and processing structured data.
  Matplotlib & Seaborn – For visualizing trends and insights in the data.
  Jupyter Notebook – For executing the code and documenting the findings.
